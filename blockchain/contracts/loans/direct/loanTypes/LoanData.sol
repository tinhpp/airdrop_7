     * We are referring instead to a nonce that is used by the lender or the borrower when they are first signing
     * off-chain Loan orders. These nonce can be any uint256 value that the user has not previously used to sign an
     * off-chain order. Each nonce can be used at most once per user within Loan, regardless of whether they are the
     * lender or the borrower in that situation. This serves two purposes:
     * - First, it prevents replay attacks where an attacker would submit a user's off-chain order more than once.
     * - Second, it allows a user to cancel an off-chain order by calling Loan.cancelLoanCommitmentBeforeLoanHasBegun()
     * , which marks the nonce as used and prevents any future loan from using the user's off-chain order that contains
     * that nonce.
     * @param expiry - Date when the signature expires
